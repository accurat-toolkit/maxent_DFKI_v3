barack obama, a wise and courageous leader, is -- i have no doubt about it -- not merely interested in improving america's image in the eyes of the muslim world.
he also seeks israel's welfare and security, and says to us, "enough.
stop harming yourselves and your own future.
even if you don't believe in palestinians' real desire for peace, their capacity to hold terrorist organizations at bay, or their renunciation of the alleged right of return, you can always protect your security with a military presence in palestinian territories rather than prejudicing the future peace and the two-state solution by expanding useless settlements."
with such a clear and direct appeal to the israeli government, america's president not only expresses what a majority of israelis know.
he also proves his profound friendship for the jewish state.
netanyahu's useless demand
a lot of water had to pass under the bridge before the idea of a two-state solution, whether as a moral or a practical matter, began to filter into the israeli and palestinian political and ideological environments.
people gradually became accustomed to the expression "palestinian state," and those who embraced it received support and gained prestige on the international scene.
after the labor leaders shimon peres, yitzhak rabin, and ehud barak embraced the two-state concept, there came the first tentative movements in that direction from likud members: tzipi livni, ehud olmert, and ariel sharon.
now, from the very bastion of the right, came benjamin netanyahu.
we can congratulate ourselves: better late than never!
we are all aware that the road toward the realization of this dream is full of obstacles and difficulties, both on the israeli and the palestinian side.
i believe that some of the preconditions posed by the israeli prime minister in his recent, widely reported speech are fully justified.
others, however, are useless and only complicate further an already complex and problematic situation.
netanyahu's demand that the future palestinian state be demilitarized is just, reasonable, and necessary.
one look at a map is enough to understand this.
even egypt, a great and sovereign nation, accepted demilitarization of sinai as a part of its peace process with israel.
indeed, demilitarization of sinai is one of the fundamental elements of the stability of egypt's peace with israel.
other great and independent countries, such as japan, germany, and austria, have been subjected for decades to limitations on their acquisition of certain weapons and military equipment.
similarly, the refusal of palestinian refugees' claim to a right of return to israel proper is understandable, logical, and just.
what sense would it make to bring back millions of palestinians into a state whose character and symbols are foreign to them -- a state where the majority belongs to another ethnic group?
are they to go back to homes and farms that no longer exist?
these refugees could much more properly establish themselves in the new state of palestine, their mother country, among their compatriots, under a palestinian flag and palestinian authority, merely 30 kilometers from the homes and farms that they abandoned, or from which they were expelled, more than 60 years ago.
but the other condition demanded by netanyahu, that the palestinians recognize the right of the jewish people to their own state, or the existence of the jewish nation, is completely arbitrary.
in my opinion, it is superfluous to ask the palestinians to recognize the nationhood of a people with thousands of years of history and a state that maintains diplomatic relations with 150 countries around the world.
a demand of this kind was not made of egypt or jordan when israel signed peace agreements with those countries, and it constitutes an entirely useless obstacle on the road to peace with the palestinians.
it will be more than sufficient to ask the palestinians to recognize the legitimacy of the state of israel, a state whose territorial boundaries and political identity are known to all.
on our part, we also will be recognizing not so much the palestinian people, which one day may merge with the people of jordan, as an independent and sovereign palestinian state within the 1967 borders.
framing the issue in this way makes sense for two reasons.
first, the question of jewish nationality is, in fact, very complicated, even for jews themselves, as many consider themselves jewish only in a religious sense.
second, the palestinians' refusal to recognize israel as a jewish state is motivated by, among other things, the presence of a palestinian minority in israel.
but relations between israel's jewish majority and arab minority is an internal, delicate question in which it is not wise to involve palestinians outside of israel.
for more than 60 years, the two groups have managed to live together in an acceptable manner, confronting with relative dignity the inferno of terrorism and the occupation of the west bank and gaza strip.
with the advent of peace, we all hope that this bond will become consolidated around a common israeli citizenship.
there will be enough problems in negotiating the creation of a palestinian state, so we should avoid adding other, gratuitous obstacles.
let's focus on resolving the most important of the problems -- demilitarization, settlements, borders, and refugees -- and allow the reality of peace to leave behind, or postpone until the distant future, the solution of problems that are essentially historical and theological.
a "portfolio" approach to climate change
the new negotiations will have one advantage over the earlier efforts, because governments now understand the need for a portfolio of adaptation, mitigation, and research efforts.
new research that my colleagues and i undertook for the copenhagen consensus center in denmark explores the effectiveness of different responses to this global challenge, but it strongly supports the portfolio approach for several reasons.
first, we now know that adaptation will be essential, because temperatures will rise by another 0.6°c by 2100 even if greenhouse gas emissions are eliminated tomorrow.
we also know that the impact of climate change will not be evenly distributed across the globe.
in some areas, modestly warmer temperatures could produce higher crop yields if associated changes in precipitation patterns are not adverse and/or irrigation remains viable.
even with 0.6°c warming, however, africa and south asia will experience almost immediate reductions in the viability of many crops and, eventually, increased vulnerability to infectious disease.
these impacts will clearly hit the planet's worst-off inhabitants hardest: the "bottom billion" who already bear the heaviest burden of disease, poverty, conflict and malnutrition. 
ensuring that adaptive capacity is expanded and exploited where it is most needed is thus a key challenge.
long-term development may give countries more capacity to soften the impact of climate change on the environment and citizens' health, but in the meantime the planet's poorest people will need help from the rich.
our analysis investigated, for example, the merits of more targeted policies for the near term: purchasing mosquito-resistant bed nets and oral re-hydration malaria therapy for children in the poorest nations affected by climate change.
the goal was to deal aggressively and proactively with some of the marginal health impacts of global warming.
benefits would appear almost immediately, but would dissipate over time as economies developed.
even as development improves conditions, however, reducing carbon emissions would become increasingly important over the longer term as the impact of climate change become more severe.
since the effects of climate change have been observed in many areas around the world, thinking about mitigation makes sense everywhere.
but we found that mitigation alone did not meet a standard cost-benefit test.
we allowed specified annual costs of climate policy to grow in proportion with global gdp through 2100 from an initial annual benchmark of $18 billion.
the discounted cost of the resulting stream of fixed annual costs totaled $800 billion, but damages avoided by this approach amounted to a discounted value of only $685 billion.
the copenhagen consensus study also examined a portfolio option of the sort heralded by the united nations' intergovernmental panel on climate change.
we allocated $50 billion to research into greener technology, so that only $750 billion could be absorbed by the economic cost of adaptation and mitigation.
the gap between the cost of carbon-free and carbon-emitting technology fell, and the taxes designed to mitigate emissions became more effective.
as a result, the research and development program essentially paid for itself, and total discounted benefits for the $800 billion investment climbed to more than $2.1 trillion. 
ensuring that research and development is part of the world's climate change response portfolio would make mitigation efforts more efficient and significantly enhance their ability to reduce carbon emissions over the next century.
but these favorable net benefits reflect very conservative assumptions regarding the timing of emissions reductions and when the developing world would "come onboard."
optimizing investment in the portfolio over time would, for example, increase the discounted benefits by more than a factor of three.
expected benefits would increase further if we included the chance that potentially higher climate sensitivities would exacerbate damages, even though doing so would require including similarly plausible lower climate sensitivities, which would push in the opposite direction.
fighting climate change can be a sound investment, even though neither mitigation nor adaptation alone will be enough to "solve" the problem.
to make a real difference, especially in the near term, the world must combine mitigation and adaptation with increased research and development into carbon-saving and sequestering technology, which in turn requires designing and exploiting market-based incentives.
don't shut the door on africa
experts are unanimous: the financial, food and energy crisis will hammer the "bottom billion" -- the poorest in some 60 countries that survive on around a dollar a day -- the hardest.
because of the crisis, many african countries are likely to miss the 2015 deadline for the millennium development goal of poverty reduction.
the continent has made some significant socio-economic gains over the last decade.
i've seen this for myself during recent travels to benin, ghana, ethiopia, egypt, namibia, nigeria, senegal, and south africa.
these gains include, to name a few: free-market reforms, liberalization of economies, the steady introduction of pro-business environments, empowerment of women, education.
but most of these gains are now seriously threatened.
the financial crisis has dealt a blow to remittances.
migrants are losing their jobs or struggling to set aside cash for their relatives back home.
the world bank's latest global economic outlook suggests remittances will fall by 5% to 8% this year.
but this is just the tip of the iceberg of the tens of millions that can be tracked.
foreign companies are pulling back capital, drying import and export financing.
trade is declining.
the unemployment rate, especially among disadvantaged groups -- young people and women -- is staggering.
in sierra-leone alone, over 60% of the country's youth are jobless.
a failure to help the &quot;bottom billion&quot; could fuel mass migration and global insecurity.
ignoring the poorest nations means postponing a much larger crisis which will lead to famine, unrest, and massive migration.
poverty is also an incubator for diseases, and the flow of legal and illegal migrants will carry them to rich nations.
poverty is not just ‘their' problem.
it is ‘our' problem too.
if developing countries collapse, there will be millions knocking on our front doors, and the first port of call will be europe.
such mass migration will severely hurt already strained social relations in some countries and lead to unpredictable consequences.
only a coordinated global response can guarantee that in the long run people from the poorest billion will visit europe as tourists and business partners, not as asylum seekers.
africa needs to do its share.
it needs investments to shift away from a dependence on a donor-driven agenda and peasant-driven agriculture, and learn to compete on a global level.
it can generate sustainable growth through industrialization, and by creating a single market.
it needs to promote production and trade, expand agribusiness and agro-industries, and create wealth and new jobs.
agribusiness development can stimulate broader economic growth, boost regional trade, and at the same time enhance food security, and reduce poverty.
globalization has been good to many in the developing world.
at this critical moment, we can't allow this to fade away.
we need to make this a more inclusive process, and make sure that:
·        financial resources keep flowing to africa and the developing world so they continue integrating into the global economy;
·        protectionism is avoided and markets stay open;
·        the poorest nations can grow out of poverty through trade;
·        there is good governance of natural resources to fuel broader and inclusive development
the abundance of relevant experiences from the newly industrialized countries in asia and elsewhere can show african countries how to galvanize their economies, accelerating the process of wealth creation and poverty reduction on the continent. 
and last but not least. development without access to energy won't happen.
this crisis could help formulate a new approach: increase access to reliable, affordable and renewable energy services for sustainable development, promote energy efficiency to make sure economic growth does not raise energy demand and environmental degradation, including climate change.
africa has great hydropower potential but only 7% has been exploited so far.
africa's natural gas reserves amount to about 8% of global reserves.
it has 10% of global oil reserves.
but it requires major investments to develop both traditional energy means and renewable ones.  
it is still unclear exactly how much of the $1 trillion pledged at the london g20 summit will find its way to africa.
that's why we need to keep an eye on the figures and keep reminding world leaders of the needs of those in the developing world that live in their shadow.
this will set policy priorities straight, put strategies in place to avert a human catastrophe, and help africa secure its rightful place at the global economic table.
ending the silent russo-european war
such mistrust poses an obvious threat to trade and investment between russia and the eu.
russia's trade with the eu between january and august 2007 reached $173.3 billion, or 51.6% of its foreign trade turnover.
more than a half of russia's goods are sold in europe, and two of its top three trade partners are european: germany, with turnover of $31.9 billion, and the netherlands, $28.3 billion.
similarly, european countries account for 75% of direct investment in russia.
britain ranks first, pouring in more than $15 billion in the first half of 2007, despite the litvinenko case and the tit-for-tat expulsion of diplomats during this period.
nevertheless, the volume of foreign investment falls short of what russia needs, for its economy is unbalanced.
more than half of its exports are oil and gas, with the rest mainly chemicals and agricultural products.
petrodollars are russia's main resource for the development of an information-based society.
eu countries will continue to demand energy, and siberian deposits are far from exhausted.
as a result, diversification of russia's economy seems a distant prospect -- all the more so because russia's bureaucracy, together with the state's interest in "strategic" areas of the economy, repels foreign business.
indeed, europeans constantly reproach russia for the increasing level of state interference.
russia's relations with the eu are governed by an agreement signed in june 1994 concerning trade, business and investment, competition issues, protection of intellectual, industrial, and business property, and financial cooperation.
over time, economic cooperation between the two sides has grown more complex, and a new legal framework is needed.
but the european commission is unable to start working on a new agreement until it has a mandate from the 27 eu member states.
such a mandate has not yet been secured.
at the same time, conditions for russian investment in the eu are far from perfect.
investors face political discrimination and administrative and technical barriers, especially concerning the power industry.
some eu "open" tenders have turned out to be closed to russian companies.
economic nationalism is growing.
foreign investment is limited in sectors that the eu considers to be strategically and politically important.
russian companies have had to face anti-dumping claims. european branches of russian banks face over-regulation and expensive certification procedures.
in september 2007, a move by the european commission to prevent foreign companies from controlling european energy transport networks was an example of a skirmish in this "silent war."
the commission's order to "unbundle" energy companies into transport and distribution units is hardly likely to encourage foreign energy companies working in the eu to seek structural reforms in the russian economy.
business leaders in europe and russia are beginning to seek a bold way out of this impasse: a common economic space between russia and the eu.
but free trade and closer integration can be achieved only if supported by national governments.
russia's new minister for economic development and commerce, elvira nabiullina, said recently that european business "is russia's main partner on international markets," and that cooperation "is one of the cornerstones of russian foreign economic policy."
she points to the government's promise to create a comfortable environment for business by continuing institutional reforms and assisting in the development of financial markets.
such statements are encouraging.
but russian business needs a comprehensive action plan, which should include cutting bureaucracy, implementing real administrative reform, freeing the economy from excessive state control, and radical measures to combat corruption.
russia also has to become integrated into the international economic system, accepting the rules applied by the rest of the world.
russia's eventual accession to the world trade organization will be crucial to this development, and its accession needs to be promoted more actively by europe as well as by russia.
the long-delayed new trade and investment agreement will be less relevant once russia is in the wto, whose rules take precedence over those of regional economic organizations.
the legitimacy of european laws limiting the scope of russian business activity in europe and contradicting wto regulations would immediately be questioned.
russia's business leaders are ready to work for the creation of a common economic space between russia and the eu.
for russia, such integration would provide a real spark for economic and social modernization.
russia's government will, of course, have the final word in this matter.
but it is unlikely to balk at a policy that treats russia fairly.
after chernobyl
kiev: chernobyl, the world's most notorious nuclear power plant, will be shut down today, fourteen years after it spewed clouds of radioactive dust into the atmosphere.
back then, ukraine became the focus of global attention, but ukrainians learned of the disaster much later than the rest of the world.
i recall that fateful saturday afternoon with utter clarity, strolling through kiev with my six-year-old daughter, oblivious to the danger.
chernobyl changed ukraine forever, and was a catalyst for the downfall of the soviet union.
ultimately, chernobyl changed the world.
now that chernobyl will be permanently shut down, world attention again turns to ukraine, this time in hope, not fear.
shutting down a vital source of electrical energy, which chernobyl remains, is no an easy task, particularly with winter upon us.
ukraine's energy infrastructure is weak; losing 8-10% of our electricity production and $100 million in revenues will strain the system even more.
we also bear the responsibilities involved in laying off chernobyl's workers and depriving the adjacent city of slavutych (population 28,000), of its main source of income.
moreover, we must continue dealing with the technical and ecological issues surrounding the chernobyl sarcophagus, as well as maintain nuclear safety in the remaining nuclear plants in operation in ukraine, including what is left of chernobyl.
in recent years, ukraine alone financed all the costs of dealing with the chernobyl disaster, consistently spending 5-10% of our state budget revenues to this end.
dealing with the aftermath of the disaster will remain a financial burden even with the plant closed.
yet closing the plant proves that we keep our promises.
we committed to shut down chernobyl this year in an agreement with the g-7 countries and the european commission.
closure of the last remaining reactor at chernobyl, i believe, must mark the beginning of a new phase of cooperation with the european union and g-7 countries.
closing chernobyl may be the most dramatic, but it is only a single episode in our reform efforts.
when we gained independence, the world expected great things from ukraine.
over the course of a decade, the world appeared to forget about us.
now we finally have a chance to break out of the downward spiral of economic decline.
at long last, our society and economy are set on the path to growth and development.
after pro-reform forces secured victory in last year's presidential elections, all of the branches of government began cooperating to entrench democracy and the market economy in ukraine.
for the first time since independence, ukraine recorded growth in industrial output of 12.5% in the first 11 months of 2000, and gdp has grown by 5.4% this year.
tough decisions were made, not least involving the energy sector.
barter payments, -- which stifled the energy market -- were eliminated. so too tax breaks and other privileges that skewed the playing field in favor of a select few.
we are also doing everything possible to make ukraine attractive to foreign investors.
in the energy sector, we are privatizing state-owned energy distributors.
to ensure complete transparency in the tender process, and eliminate problems experienced in the past, western advisors are assisting us.
for our intention is to attract large western energy companies with experience in this field as strategic investors.
ten leading international energy companies, indeed, will participate in the privatization of the first group of companies.
by the end of next year, we will privatize 12 additional energy companies.
in its sheer scale, this may be the largest single energy privatization ever attempted in europe.
our energy companies service a territory the size of france; they will all be privatized.
of course, these reforms are resisted, primarily by the oligarchs who thrive on a lack of transparency and use privileged access to state resources to enhance their business interests.
by eliminating barter and requiring monetary payment, we curtailed their opportunities to profit at the state's expense.
although we can and will continue the fight against corruption, we cannot do everything alone.
international support for our efforts is crucial.
a positive sign here is the recent decision by the european bank for reconstruction and development (ebrd) to provide $215 million to complete the nuclear power stations at rivne and khmelnytsky, which will compensate for the loss of chernobyl's generating capacity.
euroatom is also helping with a loan of $585 million to finance repairs at ukraine's functioning nuclear power plants.
in return, ukraine will uphold its end of the deal: in addition to closing chernobyl, we will introduce western nuclear safety standards and renew cooperation with the imf via the extended fund facility program.
we still need other potential creditors to confirm their involvement.
closing chernobyl will not eliminate the chernobyl threat.
our people will be unable to live on thousands of acres of contaminated earth for hundreds of years.
the concrete sarcophagus built over the destroyed reactor must be renovated.
we are grateful to all the donor countries who, with contributions from our own state budget, helped raise the $760 million needed to make the sarcophagus safer.
in the end, chernobyl's legacy does not belong solely to ukraine, for ours is a country located in the heart of europe.
we are a european nation.
we realize that no one will implement reforms for us.
the west can, however, help speed up and facilitate our efforts, as it did with the closure of chernobyl.
cooperation between ukraine and the west, without a disaster to concentrate everyone's minds, will benefit all concerned.
the war against iraqi women
in iraq's second largest city, basra, a stronghold of conservative shia groups, as many as 133 women were killed last year for violating "islamic teachings" and in so-called "honor killings," according to the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs.
the methods are brutal evidence of a backlash by previously subdued tribal forces that have been unleashed by the occupation: women strangled and beheaded, and their hands, arms and legs chopped off.
with us forces in iraq now funding both sunni and shia tribal leaders in an effort to stabilize the country, conditions for women grow deadlier by the day.
islamist leaders have imposed new restrictions on women, including prohibitions on work, bans on travel without a muhram (male guardian), and compulsory veiling.
according to the organization of women's freedom in iraq (owfi), formed in baghdad in 2003, women are harassed if they appear in the streets of most iraqi cities and towns, educational institutions, or work places.
now there are even "no woman zones" in some southern cities controlled by islamist parties and tribal leaders.
honor killings of iraqi women are justified by alleged promiscuity or adultery.
in fact, the practice targets holders of phd's, professionals, political activists, and office workers.
"politically active women, those who did not follow a strict dress code, and women human rights defenders were increasingly at risk of abuse, including by armed groups and religious extremists," amnesty international said in its 2007 report. 
indeed, a top police official in basra reported that as many as 15 women are killed every month in the city.
ambulance drivers in basra, paid to "clean the streets" before people go to work, pick up many more bodies of women every morning.
ironically, the forces leading this assault on women had little or no power under saddam hussein.
but, following the us-led invasion in 2003, southern iraq was opened to forces known as propagation of virtue and prevention of vice (pvpv) -- militant gangs and individuals committed to archaic islamic rule and suppression of women's rights.
some members of these groups now serve in government, others in militias or as self-appointed vigilantes or hired guns.
the goal of the pvpv is to confine women to the domestic realm and end all female participation in public and political life.
to date, iraqi officials have not been willing to deal with this escalating violence against women, or even to discuss it.
but, as elected representatives, they are obligated to address these crimes.
so must the us.
under the fourth geneva convention, the responsibility for protecting civilian populations in an occupied country belongs to the occupying forces, which, in this case, are clearly failing to protect iraqi women.
two measures are urgently needed.
first, the iraqi government must immediately establish "protection of women" security patrols in iraq's southern cities.
these patrols must receive gender-sensitive training and prioritize women's security over tribal or fundamentalist religious values.
second, pursuant to its obligations under the geneva convention, the us must immediately take steps to protect the lives and freedoms of iraqi civilians. unless the us does so, it must withdraw from iraq, because the occupation would merely continue to sustain a breeding ground for violence against women.
the timetable for action is not subject to debate.
it must begin today.
obama in africa
scholars speak of "the empire striking back," referring to former colonized peoples, such as immigrants from africa and india, settling in europe and north america and then challenging norms of race and identity.
in his first official trip to africa, us president barack obama is striking back in a novel way.
his visit to ghana highlights the desirability of prominent people from the diaspora making a positive contribution to african affairs.
but obama's visit, while heavy on symbolism, reveals the limits of his power.
burdened by economic problems in america and wars in iraq and afghanistan, he can't act boldly in africa or make big promises.
indeed, six months into his presidency, he has already undercut expectations.
he has approached with great caution the task of settling the region's violent conflicts -- in darfur, eastern congo, and somalia.
he has also kept a safe distance from africa's political failures, notably in zimbabwe, where he has resisted calls to assist in the removal of robert mugabe.
obama's caution is reasonable.
he doesn't want to be pigeon-holed, after all, as "the president of africa."
but, in choosing restraint over intervention, he has disappointed ordinary africans and international activists alike.
like his predecessors, george w. bush and bill clinton, obama wants to avoid messy entanglements in africa's internal politics.
bush did nothing to stop the killings in darfur or hasten mugabe's exit from power.
clinton, meanwhile, shamefully abandoned somalia after the deaths of american soldiers in mogadishu -- and did nothing in the face of rwanda's genocide.
for obama, africa so far chiefly remains a backdrop against which he defines his american identity.
as he explained in his memoir dreams from my father , visiting his father's native kenya for the first time made him feel more american -- and less african -- than ever.
in deciding to visit ghana, a former british colony and a leading node in the global slave trade of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, obama bypassed the kenya of his father. kenya is embroiled in bitter tribal disputes, and saddled with a brazenly corrupt government.
by contrast, ghana represents the sunny side africa.
the country recently completed a well-run election in which the opposition took power.
its economy is growing. ethnic relations in this highly diverse nation are as good as they are anywhere in the world.
obama will be on african soil for a mere two days, during which time he is expected to emphasize america's role in promoting good governance and non-violence in africa -- goals long high on america's public agenda.
obama's one new priority -- to expand us support for african farmers -- reflects a shrewd appreciation of how the expansion of agriculture can quickly lift many rural africans out of poverty.
"the administration plans over a number of years to put a substantial amount of money into agricultural development," obama's choice for secretary of state for african affairs, johnnie carson, said in advance of the president's trip.
don't expect obama to confront the most controversial aspect of us relations with africa: the american military's new african command.
bush, who created the command, gave the us department of defense new powers to work on civilian issues in africa and to expand its military partnerships with governments in the region.
obama isn't likely to say whether he'll scale back the us military role in the region, or whether america's growing reliance on african oil is the real reason -- not obama's heritage -- for wooing africans. obama's lack of candor won't hurt him in the us, where domestic political calculations take precedence.
in truth, his visit to africa is a reward to his stalwart african-american supporters, who voted overwhelmingly for him in the november election and who remain one pillar of his base.
for african-americans, ghana has special meaning.
the country played an important role in the push for civil rights in america, for instance.
in 1957, when legal segregation seemed entrenched in the us, ghana's first president, kwame nkrumah, used the occasion of his country's independence from britain to highlight the injustices experienced daily by black americans.
he invited martin luther king, jr. to his inauguration, giving the atlanta-based civil rights leader a global platform for the first time.
malcolm x, the black nationalist leader, visited ghana two years later, and again in 1964.
nkrumah invited w.e.b. du bois, the most important black intellectual of the twentieth century, to ghana in 1961.
du bois became a citizen and lived in ghana until his death.
hundreds of african-americans live year round in ghana today, some within a short walk of cape coast castle, the slaving fort that shipped human cargo until britain halted the trade in 1807.
learned and deeply reflective, obama knows that black americans will view his visit to ghana very differently than white americans will.
his tendency to view africa through an american lens is thus both understandable and inevitable.
yet his african roots give him a unique capacity to transform american relations with africa, elevating the importance of african self-reliance and achievement, while striving to make american aid more intelligent and effective.
outsourcing in africa
in the past 40 years, advanced computers and communications have transformed one part of the world after another - first, the us and europe, then japan, korea, and taiwan, and most recently, india, china, and eastern europe.
is africa next?
despite civil wars, malnutrition, and the anguish of the aids epidemic, something remarkable is happening in black africa: the stealthy rise of a high-technology sector.
if not quite representing an african "silicon valley," these shoots of high-tech industry nonetheless can and must be nurtured if africa is to thrive.
consider what is happening on several floors of a single high-rise office building in accra, ghana's capital.
there some 1,500 africans process american health-insurance claims - working around the clock, in three shifts.
the africans speak english, type at least 50 words a minute on a computer, take data from paper claim forms supplied by us health insurers via satellite in electronic form, put it into new digital forms, and ship them back to the us.
so connected are these africans that their forms can be reviewed - as they fill them in - by an american supervisor 8,000 miles away.
ghana is best known for producing cocoa and gold, but today affiliated computer services (acs), a texas company that runs the outsourcing operation, is the country's largest private employer.
african "key punchers" earn $4 to $5 a day - four times the legal minimum wage - and receive health insurance, meals, and subsidized transport.
a small number of african engineers and professionals earn much more, and receive periodic training in advanced technologies.
acs's employees are but the first africans to benefit from the hottest trend in the global economy: outsourcing, or the shift of service jobs from high-wage to low-wage countries.
to be sure, the number of jobs moving to africa is tiny compared to those going to asia, latin america, and eastern europe.
but the big news is that africa is finally competing in the economic contest that is reshaping the world economy.
still, africa remains burdened by severe disadvantages, not the least of which is a terrible image.
"big corporations don't even have africa on the map when they consider outsourcing locations," says sambou makalou, a native of mali who tries to persuade us employers to shift service jobs to africa.
"there are real opportunities for outsourcing to africa," he says, "but there are barriers, too."
african governments also must be willing to start small: expend a lot of effort to attract pilot projects in the hope of larger employment in the future.
with sensible reforms, many barriers can be removed or at least eased.
start with the following:
· better governance : african governments often boast when they simply stop the corrosive effects of corruption and irrational business regulation.
but little attention is given to the high cost of telecommunications, unreliable electrical-power systems, and the poor transport infrastructure.
• greater competitiveness : african leaders have been slow to realize that they must woo foreign corporations with special services, training programs for workers, and even subsidized offices.
asian countries attract many jobs by creating "industrial parks," with more reliable services, including ultra-reliable communications networks, offered at competitive prices.
by restructuring their secondary schools and universities to train graduates with skills demanded by multinational corporations, asian countries also create more competitive workforces.
to be sure, africa is a far better place to do business than five years ago.
the spread of mobile telephony has revolutionized ordinary life in a continent with the world's lowest penetration of fixed-line telephones.
satellite links have vastly improved internet access, and a new undersea cable that runs along the coast of africa (sat-3) promises to improve and reduce the cost of all types of communications.
the problem is that, although africa's economic appeal is increasing, india and china are improving more quickly, widening the gap.
african cities are increasingly finding their way onto the short lists of corporate location experts, only to lose out to asian cities.
africans can start winning only if they move faster.
surprisingly, wage competitiveness is a problem.
although africa is the world's poorest region on average, wages in the formal economy generally exceed those paid in china and india, where government keeps basic food, housing, and transport costs relatively low through subsidies and controls.
in urban africa, costs - for food and transport in particular - are relatively high, which forces wages up.
the supply of african professionals and skilled workers, meanwhile, is tight; shortages also drive up wages.
indeed, an indian software programmer typically earns less than a comparable african programmer.
even wages for routine data-entry tasks in africa are usually no less than those paid in south asia.
the odds that africa one day will receive a fair share of outsourcing jobs are improving.
but there is a risk that the region will fall further behind.
when acs decided to expand recently, it opened a new operation in india rather than in ghana or another african country.
the message was sobering.
even as hundreds of similar outsourcing centers spring up in asia, eastern europe, and latin america, the accra center remains a rarity in africa.
that is a shame, but it need not be africa's fate.
let's have meat.
let's have eggs."
in pursuit of protein-rich meals, nkhoma is pushing her cluster of villages, representing a thousand households in all, to begin raising chickens for eggs and meat, cows for milk, and "exotic" vegetables such as cabbage for vitamins.
her can-do attitude is matched by remarkable energy.
in the space of just three weeks, she visited 96 villages to promote chicken-raising.
to be sure, nkhoma's ideas about how to transform the lives of peasant farmers in africa are not new.
experts have been preaching crop diversity, irrigation, and improved soil nutrients for decades.
what has been missing, however, are energetic extension workers, brimming with pride in their own people and passion for new approaches.
nkhoma is one of the best front-line farm advisers in malawi, which is why she works on the country's united nations-sponsored millennium village, one of only 12 in africa.
nkhoma's own story mirrors the shift in the status of farming in africa.
she is part of a new generation of urban africans committed to integrating farmers and markets -- and to getting their hands dirty.
"the field is my office," she says.
after working for more than ten years as a government farm adviser and accomplishing little, she was chosen by a foreign donor to gain a bachelor's degree in agriculture.
after graduation, she joined the millennium village project, which gives her wide latitude to innovate, together with the resources to set in motion her inspired plans.
"if you have an energetic extension worker, you only need to change the mindset of the people," she says.
"when that happens, change can occur very quickly.
but you must have the resources, the support.
if you don't have the resources, all your work is for nothing."
that's where the un and the economist jeffrey sachs come in.
sachs has raised about $150 million for the villages, enough for five years of support.
each household in the project receives about $100 a year in seeds, fertilizers, and other supports.
sachs knows the freebies to farmers guarantee gains in the short run, but he's convinced that african villagers, once freed from "the poverty trap," can thrive on their own.
the "browning" of african technology
the chinese are no strangers to rwanda.
near tingiri's office, rwanda's largest telecom company, rwandatel, is installing new wireless telephony equipment made by huawei of shenzen.
africa boasts the world's fastest-growing market for wireless telephony, and huawei -- with offices in 14 african countries -- is running away with the business, sending scores of engineers into the bush to bring a new generation of low-cost technology to some of the planet's poorest people.
motivated by profit and market share rather than philanthropy, huawei is outpacing american and european rivals through lower prices, faster action, and a greater willingness to work in difficult environments.
according to chris lundh, the american chief of rwandatel, "that's the way things work in africa now.
the chinese do it all."
well, not quite.
across sub-saharan africa, engineers from india -- armed with appropriate technologies honed in their home market -- are also making their mark.
india supplies africa with computer-education courses, the most reliable water pumps, low-cost rice-milling equipment, and dozens of other technologies.
the sudden influx of chinese and indian technologies represents the "browning" of african technology, which has long been the domain of "white" americans and europeans who want to apply their saving hand to african problems.
"it is a tectonic shift to the east with shattering implications," says calestous juma, a kenyan professor at harvard university who advises the african union on technology policy.
one big change is in education.
there are roughly 2,000 african students in china, most of whom are pursuing engineering and science courses.
according to juma, that number is expected to double over the next two years, making china "africa's leading destination for science and engineering education."
the "browning" of technology in africa is only in its infancy, but the shift is likely to accelerate.
chinese and indian engineers hail from places that have much more in common with nitty-gritty africa than comfortable silicon valley or cambridge.
africa also offers a testing ground for asian-designed technologies that are not yet ready for us or european markets.
a good example is a solar-powered cooking stove from india, which has experimented with such stoves for decades.
wood-burning stoves are responsible for much of africa's deforestation, and, in many african cities, where wood accounts for the majority of cooking fuel, its price is soaring.
the indian stove is clearly a work-in-progress; it is too bulky and not durable enough to survive the rigors of an african village.
but with india's vast internal market, many designers have an incentive to improve it.
how many designers in america or europe can say the same?
of course, technology transfer from china and india could be a mere smokescreen for a new "brown imperialism" aimed at exploiting african oil, food, and minerals.
in recent years, china's government alone has invested billions of dollars in african infrastructure and resource extraction, raising suspicions that a new scramble for africa is underway.
but africans genuinely need foreign technology, and the chinese, in particular, are pushing hard -- even flamboyantly -- to fill the gap.
this year, nigeria's government bought a chinese-made satellite, and even paid the chinese to launch it into space in may.
china was so eager to provide space technology to africa's most populous country that it beat out 21 other bidders for a contract worth $300 million.
china's technology inroads are usually less dramatic, but no less telling.
in african medicine, chinese herbs and pharmaceuticals are quietly gaining share.
for example, the chinese-made anti-malarial drug artesunate has become part of the standard treatment within just a few years.
likewise, chinese mastery over ultra-small, cheap "micro-hydro" dams, which can generate tiny amounts of electricity from mere trickles of water, appeals to power-short, river-rich africans.
tens of thousands of micro-hydro systems operate in china, and nearly none in africa.
americans do-gooders like nicholas negroponte, with his $100 laptop, have identified the right problem: africa is way behind technologically and rapid leap-frogging is possible.
but chinese and indian scientists argue that africa can benefit from a changing of the technological guard.
they may be right.
uganda's smart protectionism
working smarter is no empty slogan; it is the key to modernizing african agriculture.
an advocate of food self-sufficiency for uganda, bukenya wants ugandans to eat more homegrown rice, thereby boosting local farmers and rice millers while freeing hard cash for higher uses.
bukenya has long promoted a new strain of african rice that grows in uplands (as opposed to wetland paddies) and requires less water.
embracing the new rice is part of the working-smarter formula.
once rice output began to expand, bukenya and other ugandan politicians played another smart card: they lobbied successfully for a 75% duty on foreign rice, which stimulated rice production further.
rice output has risen by two and a half times since 2004, according to the ministry of trade, to 180,000 metric tons, while consumption of imported rice fell by half from 2004 to 2005 alone.
uganda's importers, seeing the shift, have invested in new mills in the country, expanding employment and creating competition for farmers' output, improving prices.
new mills, meanwhile, lowered the cost of bringing domestic rice to market, so that consumers now still pay about the same for rice as they always have.
and uganda is poised to start exporting rice within east africa and beyond.
"it's a very important crop for raising income and commercializing agriculture," says nelson gagawala wambuzi, minister of state for trade.
uganda's success in expanding rice production is especially interesting given that the people of sub-saharan africa spend nearly $2 billion a year on rice grown outside of africa.
the amount of spending on rice alone by africans equals the combined national budgets of ghana and senegal.
as more africans move to cities, they acquire a taste for rice, which is easy to store and can be cooked quickly.
but such spending on imported rice is a scandal, because, with the help of wise policies, african farmers could grow much more rice, perhaps enough to eliminate virtually all imports.
much of the rice grown in pakistan, vietnam, and especially america is stimulated by subsidies, and then dumped into african markets at low prices -- sometimes below the cost of production.
these rice exporters, including the us, also maintain stiff import duties, thereby protecting domestic farmers from global competition.
african governments sharply reduced or eliminated duties on imported rice in the 1990's, urged on by the world bank, the international monetary fund, and influential free-market economists.
the assumption was that rich countries would reciprocate by curtailing subsidies to their farmers.
but they haven't.
in response, a few african countries have raised duties on rice, violating a key tenet of neo-liberal trade philosophy.
but rice duties are working in uganda -- and in nigeria, where rice output is also soaring and the value of imported rice is declining -- and policymakers rightly believe that they must be maintained.
the big exporters, such as the us and vietnam, continue to supply massive subsidies to their rice farmers.
without protection, african farmers would once again be harmed by imports.
indeed, african governments might wish to look selectively at other crops.
they need to rely on a mix of economic tools, including farm protectionism, aimed at helping indigenous producers. 
virtually every successful asian economy was built on selective trade barriers -- and in china and india, the world's two fastest growing economies, such barriers remain in place.
even korea and japan maintain massive duties on imported rice simply to protect the livelihoods of their own rice farmers.
uganda and other african countries need to be careful that protectionism doesn't become a cover for inefficiency or corruption.
and selective protectionism is of course no panacea for africa, even when such policies effectively aid local producers.
but economic self-reliance is a worthy goal for most african countries, and uganda's experience suggests the potential of an approach long denigrated by the international community.
for too long, african governments have listened to the siren song of free trade -- and have suffered from too much openness, not too little.
with the us and the european union unwilling to slash their farm subsidies, uganda's rice experiment deserves wider attention, if only because it shows that africans aren't merely passive victims of international economic forces.
they are fighting back and, at least in the rice fields of uganda, they are winning.
africa's immunity
yet, in sub-saharan africa, there are few hints of the global financial crisis that is consuming the capitalist world.
in fashionable african cities, residential home prices remain stratospheric.
a typical western-style house in kampala or accra, for example, now costs an astonishing two to three times the price of a comparable home in, say, cleveland or other cities in the american heartland.
while home prices are crashing from madrid to dublin and miami to los angeles, african prices remain near or at record-high levels.
african banks, meanwhile, are rock-solid compared to their debt-heavy counterparts in the us and europe.
while international bankers went bust by making legions of bad loans, african bankers stuck to earning profits the old-fashioned way: paying very little to depositors, and earning a big "spread" by buying guaranteed government debt, which yielded healthy returns.
even government deficit spending -- long the bane of africa -- seems positively puny compared to the massive debts that the us and some european countries face.
the new obama administration is proposing spending plans that would create a record us deficit of more than one trillion dollars -- and this coming on top of the outgoing bush administration's record deficit.
and yet there are good reasons to believe that it is just a matter of time before africa and its peoples experience the ill effects of the global crisis.
from ghana to kenya, governments are having increased difficulty in raising money for infrastructure projects and selling official debt.
foreign investment in sub-saharan africa, which reached record levels in recent years, is retreating, which is evidence of investor caution, not any underlying lack of optimism about the region.
and exports of raw materials to china, india, europe, and the us -- a key factor in africa's recent growth surge -- may suffer simply because the global slowdown means less consumption everywhere.
all of these factors suggest that an african financial bust is possible.
popular equity investments, such as shares in safaricom, are already trading at unexpectedly low levels.
if real estate prices were to fall dramatically, a chain reaction could occur, taking down big and small investors alike, and over time causing wide suffering to ordinary africans.
even assuming stability in real estate prices, the global crisis surely will cause a fall in remittances by africans working good jobs in europe, the us, canada, australia, and the middle east.
remittances are already believed to be falling, which makes sense: immigrants in rich countries are and will be disproportionately hurt by slowing economic activity.
immigration itself may even slow dramatically, depending on the length and depth of the economic slowdown.
fewer africans working in rich countries will automatically translate into less money circulating in african countries.
the decline in remittances, however, cuts both ways.
remittances have long spurred inflation in many parts of africa.
a ugandan doctor working in norway, for instance, cares little about the cost of a beer in kampala.
he is also willing -- and able -- to pay more than a local doctor for services and, of course, a home in uganda.
fewer remittances flowing into uganda could mean less economic activity -- or simply lower prices.
the financial meltdown in the us, which incubated the global crisis, is either coming under control or threatening to mutate into a new, more virulent form that could destroy not only america's paper economy of trading and brokering, but also its real economy of goods and services.
president barack obama, acting as if the latter scenario remains likely, is betting on large-scale government spending to prop up the real economy.
if his administration succeeds, the chances that africa will remain relatively unscathed will grow.
even if obama fails, however, africans should escape the worst of the global crisis, for both good reasons and bad.
the good reasons have to do with african self-reliance and a growing awareness among scholars and policymakers that trade within the region -- especially between urban and rural africa -- will ultimately deliver enormous benefits.
another factor working in africa's favor is its private companies' and consumers' low dependence on borrowed money.
people tend to pay cash for goods and services, however costly.
in the us, loans for cars and homes -- loans that now aren't being paid back -- are the major factor behind the financial crisis.
in africa, very few people borrow money for such purchases.
africa's cash-based economy has in the past constrained development.
after all, by allowing people to spend more than they have, borrowed money can fuel growth.
but today, africa's pay-as-you-go practices are a powerful defense against financial contagion.
another way of looking at africa's paradoxical economic position is to admit that the region's historical marginalization within the international financial system -- so costly in times of global plenty -- is proving to be an unexpected benefit when the wealthiest of the world are sick unto death.
zuma rising
african politics has long been the exclusive domain of aristocrats, soldiers, and technocrats.
even with the spread of democratic elections, the region's leaders tend to come from the ranks of soldiers (uganda, rwanda, zimbabwe), family dynasties (togo, kenya, etc), or university professors, lawyers, and economists (ghana, malawi, liberia).
now south africa, the region's economic engine and home to its most sophisticated universities, media, and corporations, has a former goat herder at its helm, a rare african leader with the common touch.
zuma is legendary for his ability to connect with ordinary people.
he's secure enough to dance and sing in public. he speaks the language of populism, raising hopes for the vast majority of south africans who daily endure the misery of poor housing, schools, and health care.
in contrast to his two predecessors -- the saintly nelson mandela, who emphasized racial healing, and the aristocratic thabo mbeki, who reassured financiers with his strong grasp of macroeconomics -- zuma recognizes the pent-up demand for material improvement in the lives of his country's tens of millions of have-nots. "we have learned from the mistakes of the past 15 years, especially the manner of which we may have, to some degree, neglected the people's movement," he said in april, before his african national congress swept to victory.
until now, populism has been the missing note in african political culture.
zuma, who spent his youth herding cattle and only gained formal education while in the notorious robben island prison with mandela, is refreshingly aware that africa's biggest problem is its inequalities, not its global marginalization. in africa's wealthiest nation -- but also the nation where wealth is most unequally shared -- a bold populist now holds ultimate power over government policy.
yet, while zuma's populist appeal reflects south africa's especially large differences in economic class, the threat of imposing higher taxes and other obligations on employers and the wealthy has raised fears at home and internationally.
moreover, zuma has been called a chameleon, accused of telling his audiences what they want to hear.
zuma's turbulent personal life -- many wives and his embarrassing contention during a rape trial that he avoided hiv infection by taking a shower -- has invited ridicule.
most seriously, doubts persist about his commitment to democracy, with critics arguing he's an old-style african "big man" ready to bully opponents and ravage the public coffers with his cronies.
dismissing complaints, zuma insists, "there's no cloud around me."
his defenders, meanwhile, point to two benefits that he has already delivered: an end to mbeki's ambivalent approach to fighting hiv/aids, the country's major public health threat, and a refreshing willingness to move against zimbabwe's aged dictator, robert mugabe, whom mbeki coddled out of a misguided sense of loyalty for his support during the struggle against apartheid.
in an africa bereft of successful populist politicians, zuma's role models may come from latin america, where income inequality is also extreme and the trade-union movement, as in south africa, is strong and militant.
with enormous pressure from ordinary people to deliver tangible gains, zuma the populist will quickly face a major test: will he emulate lula of brazil, who has struck an admirable balance between good economic governance and re-distribution of wealth to the poor?
or will he follow the path of hugo chávez, a popular autocrat who seems to prefer building a cult of personality over raising living standards for the poor.
the stakes for africa are enormous.
south africa has the continent's largest economy and, until the global financial crisis, posted 10 years of steady economic growth.
in an economic slowdown, the country's severe crime problem might only worsen; so might unemployment, which already tops 20% in the formal economy.
zuma senses the urgency of the situation.
he is, after all, 67 years old and likely to serve only a single term in office.
"we can't waste time," he says.
yet, according to the political economist moeletsi mbeki, at his core, "zuma is a conservative." in this sense, zuma represents yesterday's south africa.
he is part of the proud generation that defeated apartheid -- and then peacefully engineered a transition to durable black-majority rule.
their achievement remains one of the greatest in recent history.
at the same time, zuma's revolutionary generation still seems uneasy leading south africa in a post-apartheid era that is now 15 years old.
in a region that reveres the elderly, zuma's attachment to his rural traditions must be matched by an equal openness to the appetites of the country's youth.
three in ten south africans are younger than 15, meaning that they did not live a day under apartheid.
somehow zuma must find a way to honor his own generation's commitment to racial justice and national liberation, while empowering the masses who daily suffer the sting of class differences and yearn for material gain.
california dying
the most populous and wealthiest of america's 50 states, california has long been a beacon of opportunity for talented and enterprising people from all over the world.
one in every four california residents was born in a foreign country.
california's two most famous industries, silicon valley and hollywood, depend on infusions of talent from abroad.
its robust agricultural sector is a massive exporter of food, benefiting from the growing appetites of consumers in developing countries.
yet california's technological and entrepreneurial might -- standing alone, the state would be the world's eighth largest economy -- coexists with a dysfunctional political system that has brought it to the edge of fiscal bankruptcy.
on may 19, the state's voters, in a special election, rejected an array of tax increases and spending cuts required to balance its budget.
now, california faces either an embarrassing federal bailout or a prolonged period of rule by judges, who under california law have the power to vacate labor agreements, abrogate contracts, and generally restructure the state's financial commitments.
for president barack obama, california's crisis imperils his own reform agenda.
because other american states also face tough fiscal conditions, the political price of bailing out california may be bailing out dozens of other states too.
a massive state bailout, while adding enormously to pressure on obama's government, would expose the weak link in the us system of governance.
so-called "unitary" nations such as britain, france, china, or kenya, essentially have a single set of government obligations: one national police force, one employer for all public school teachers, one overall pension system, etc.
by contrast, the us has an "asymmetric" form of government, which allows many overlapping government entities -- 7,000 in california alone -- to incur debts, hire and fire employees, and impose taxes.
making sense of these asymmetries is difficult.
when financial markets concentrate on the fiscal health of the federal government, they miss the extent of government obligations as a whole.
the complexity of american governance threatens the benefits of obama's decision to stimulate the economy through deficit spending.
while the national government expands, state governments, such as california's, contract.
moreover, california's crisis is more than an economic one.
california is the most diverse us state; more than half of its 37 million people are non-white.
for believers in the benefits of diversity, california represents the largest social experiment in human history, bringing people of different backgrounds together in a way unimaginable in, say, germany, china, or brazil.
california's governor, arnold schwarzenegger, was an immigrant (from austria) before he was a movie star.
in his six years in office, he has repeatedly tried to bypass a polarized state legislature -- even the annual budget requires a two-thirds majority -- by appealing directly to voters.
ballot initiatives were created 100 years ago to empower ordinary citizens, but in recent decades the process has been captured by self-serving elites.
even as california's roads fall apart and public institutions decline -- the result of too little spending and public workers who are too expensive -- the state continues to operate the finest set of public universities in the us.
but the secret of the university of california's success is its ability to obtain ever-higher amounts of funding from private sources and the federal government.
disengagement from the california polity also is true of the state's economic engines.
intel, the world's biggest chip maker and a silicon valley mainstay, hasn't built a factory in california for more than 20 years.
hollywood shoots an increasing number of films elsewhere.
agriculture relies heavily on illegal workers from mexico, who live temporarily near the fields and take their earnings back home.
how to forge a single community out of a state so diverse remains an elusive challenge.
some influential people, including schwarzenegger, say the state needs a new constitution that would restrict ballot initiatives and make budgets easier to pass.
more radical thinkers insist that california is ungovernable and should be broken into two or even three states.
creating more californias would of course require the approval of the federal government in washington, where elected representatives from california -- mainly from obama's democratic party -- have more power today than at perhaps any time in us history.
nancy pelosi, the house majority leader, is from san francisco.
californians run the two most powerful house committees, energy and commerce and education and labor.
two of the most influential senators also come from california.
why these washington politicians are idle while their state slides towards ruin says much about what's broken in american politics.
schwarzenegger is a republican, so democrats privately wish him to fail.
there's a deeper problem: politicians across the spectrum, beholden to special interests, are habituated to denying serious problems.
obama will be forced to help craft a compromise to keep the state financially afloat.
yet as a condition, he may insist that californians, who are already among the most heavily taxed americans, pay more.
if californians refuse, obama could face a widening revolt -- against the idea of expanded government as the chief response to what ails america at home.
capitalism's moral bastards
the answer may be quite simple: too many bosses have abandoned basic human values and embraced the credo famously uttered by gordon gekko in the movie wall street : "greed is good."
but a growing body of research concludes that greed is not always good, and that moral values are a necessary element in the conduct of business.
the gordon gekkos are predators who take the quick payoff.
although they do serve a useful purpose by keeping other players on their toes and raising efficiency through competition, market participants for the most part avoid them, preferring to do business with the warren buffetts -- hard-driving businessmen, but known for fair play and creating long-term value.
consider the trip to the mall, where shoppers buy goods produced and shipped from around the world.
this decentralized delivery of goods relies on employees working for two weeks before receiving a paycheck, companies offering each other lines of credit, and banks offering bridge loans.
even though humans have engaged in exchange since before the birth of civilization, the impersonal system of trading is only around 1,000 years old.
while legal remedies exist should this system break down, impersonal trading cannot occur unless most people share the values of fair play and reciprocal cooperation.
even in impersonal market exchange, we cannot help but personalize transactions, say, with the grocery store cashier who smiles and thanks us, or the store greeter whose only purpose is to make us feel cared for.
this personalization draws upon regions of the brain that evolved when our trading partners were members of small kin-based groups where moral violations were immediately identified and remedied.
research by primatologists sarah brosnan and frans de waal at emory university has shown that monkeys also have what look like moral values.
when two monkeys work for food, a fair split is expected.
if a fair division is not received, it elicits cries of outrage and hurled food by the wronged partner.
moral values have powerful physiological representations in humans, too, and we feel them strongly when they are violated.
the philosopher josh greene and his colleagues at princeton university have shown that personal moral dilemmas (for example, whether you would directly kill one person to save seven others) use our emotions rather than higher cognition -- to the chagrin of many philosophers who claimed otherwise.
the personal aspect of such decisions makes our hearts speed up and our palms sweat.
in neuroeconomics experiments that my lab has conducted, we have found that when a stranger places trust in another by making a considered monetary investment that can either be returned or stolen, our brains release an ancient mammalian hormone called oxytocin.
oxytocin is what bonds mammals to their offspring, and in humans makes spouses care about and love each other.
we have found that trust causes a spike in oxytocin and begets reciprocation -- the sharing of money.
we are "wired" to cooperate, and we find it rewarding in the same way that our brains identify eating a good meal or sex as rewarding.
oxytocin is active in evolutionarily old areas of our brain, outside of our conscious awareness.
we simply have a sense that sharing with someone who has trusted us is the right thing to do.
we have also found that about 2% of undergraduates we studied are pure non-cooperators.
when they have an opportunity to share money with a stranger who has trusted him or her, non-cooperators keep all the money rather than share the largess.
the technical term in my lab for these people is "bastards."
our evidence suggests that bastards' brains work differently.
their character traits are similar to those of sociopaths.
they simply do not care about others the way most people do, and the dysfunctional processing of oxytocin in their brains appears to be one reason for this.
because bastards are out there, we still need government and personal enforcement of economic exchange.
nevertheless, too much government regulation may "crowd out" moral behavior.
when every offense has an associated penalty, transgressions cease to be moral violations, but are simply a way for wrongdoers to effectively "use the system" while facing some risk of getting caught and paying a fine.
these external penalties can displace the internal sanctions we feel when we do wrong.
at enron, this was accomplished by breaking down tasks into small chunks so that no one person was ultimately responsible for a decision and could claim ignorance when caught.
former enron chief executive jeffrey k. skilling excused his behavior at his trial by saying, "i'm not an accountant."
many people have been convinced that market exchange diminishes our humanity.
think of charlie chaplin's film modern times , in which the little tramp is literally a cog in the capitalist machine.
that view, a residue of marxist thinking, is wrong.
on the contrary, working together, and trading with each other in markets, is morality in action.
balancing rights and military necessity
did september 11 mark the end of a period of the expansion of the human rights idea and the beginning of a process of retrenchment?
leading human rights organizations - amnesty international, human rights watch, the international commission of jurists - fear that this might indeed be the case, and they have been steeling themselves to oppose any attempt to push back their hard-won conquests.
the business of fighting poverty
from china to chile, from south korea to south africa, there is little debate about whether or not private investment is essential for prosperity and growth.
but private investment too rarely benefits the poorest of the poor--precisely those who need it most.
some blame an unfair world trading system, in which wealthy nations knock down all trade barriers except their own.
others point to the debt burdens shouldered by poor countries, or to the volatility of emerging markets.
but regulatory obstacles and unexploited marketplace gaps also prevent private capital from flowing to the poorest countries.
this keeps small businesses in poor nations and regions from reaching their full potential.
based on our own experiences--in mexico, which has opened up to foreign investment and trade, and in canada, which is a leading aid donor and a major source of private investment in developing countries--we are convinced that many of these problems can be identified, isolated and fixed.
if small businesses could expand beyond the village square, they could drive their countries' growth better than any aid agency.
this is why, when un secretary-general kofi annan and un development program administrator mark malloch brown asked us to lead a new commission on private sector and development, we agreed.
for we are both strong believers in the need for substantial foreign aid flows to the world's poorest countries.
we believe equally strongly in the public sector's role in providing essential services and infrastructure.
but ultimately, private investment must be the main source of income growth and job creation in poor countries--just as it is in industrialized nations.
if we can identify specific measures that work to unblock the private sector's potential, these recommendations can be adopted both by individual countries and by multilateral agencies like the undp.
some preliminary conclusions have already emerged:
even when budget deficits and inflation are under control, business growth is often inhibited by national and local impediments.
legal frameworks for business may be lacking, or bureaucracy may be excessive.
more action to create an ``enabling regulatory environment'' could spur immense business growth;
in the industrialized world, private financing can underwrite essential public utilities like power plants and water systems.
alongside efforts to attract foreign investment, equal energy should be directed at mobilizing and unleashing domestic capital;
in canada, as in the us and western europe, a modest home, a small plot of land or a solid credit history can be enough to secure a loan.
hernando de soto, a member of our commission, estimates that roughly $9.3 trillion in land value--largely in the hands of the poor--lies unexploited as collateral to spur investment and growth;
companies now tapping the huge consumer demand represented by the poor in developing countries are reaping big returns.
we are investigating what business insights and policy steps made such successes possible.
often, policymakers eliminated legal bottlenecks or created new institutional mechanisms to facilitate investment.
of course, continuing macroeconomic reform remains necessary.
market liberalization and trade expansion lifted millions out of poverty in the 1990's, particularly in china and india.
in other regions, developing countries that liberalized their economies and encouraged foreign investment grew faster than they otherwise would have.
part of the reason for this may be that economic reform must now move from the macro level to the micro level, from trade and monetary policy to the web of legal and financial impediments entangling small business.
when the business potential of the developing world is unleashed, the benefits will be more than economic.
indeed, private enterprise can create powerful interests vested in peace.
although businesses are competitive by nature, true entrepreneurs also instinctively collaborate in building new markets: a manufacturer in one country or region seeks marketers, financiers and distributors in other countries and regions.
ties among private companies enhance global stability.
in the formative years of the north american economy, the entrepreneurial quakers were wryly said to have come to the new world ``to do good, and they ended up doing well.''
investors in developing economies should have the opportunity to do the same.
china's exchange-rate puzzle
indeed, the economist robert mundell, whose work on optimal monetary zones is credited with laying the theoretical groundwork for the euro, insists that china should maintain its fixed exchange rate as a necessary part of its current phase of economic development.
but, owing to china's skewed economic structure, its exchange-rate regime presents much more challenging problems than those encountered by japan and other east asian economies.
pegged exchange rates clearly have been essential to east asia's economic takeoff, for they work well with the region's export-oriented development model.
but the effectiveness of a fixed exchange rate is determined by how developments in the export sector influence domestic industries and the national economy as a whole.
if growth in the trade sector boosts that of domestic non-trade sectors, then a fixed exchange rate will not put pressure on the external balance of payments as demand for imports rises.
under these circumstances, revaluation of the exchange rate will not have a severe impact on an economy's development.
for example, japanese economists argue that the  plaza agreement, which called for "orderly appreciation" of non-dollar currencies against the dollar, was a natural outgrowth of high national income.
this was one of the major reasons for japan's acceptance of the change.
but china's current situation is vastly different.
pressure for revaluation comes at a stage when per capita national income is merely $1,000, not $10,000 or $15,000, so china still needs a rather long period of rapid economic growth to reach anything like the stage that japan had achieved when it allowed the yen to be revalued.
equally important, unlike other east asian economies during their early take-off stages, the expansion of china's export sector in the last decade has not been closely linked to the development of its domestic non-trade sector, because the expansion has been fueled mainly by foreign direct investment (fdi).
most of china 460,000 foreign-owned enterprises are concentrated in manufacturing and assembling, increasing the import-intensiveness of exports and de-linking the external-trade sector from domestic industries.
this helps to widen regional disparities, especially between eastern and western china, with the wealthiest regions being those that have benefited from high concentrations of fdi.
no one should realistically expect the renminbi's exchange rate to be determined solely by the income level of the relatively prosperous eastern coastal regions.
to be sure, china has accumulated an enormous balance-of-payments surplus, which indicates that the renminbi is greatly undervalued.
but the surplus merely masks the structural problems of china's domestic economic sectors and poorer regions.
indeed, if foreign-owned enterprises exports are deducted from the total trade volume, the surplus vanishes, because both the overall balance of merchandise trade and the balance of trade in services normally run deficits.
in short, the isolation of the export sector from the rest of china's economy, caused by the dominance of fdi, accounts for the illusion of an undervalued renminbi.
although the expansion of exports has been dramatic, now accounting for 70% of china's gdp, it has exerted no pull on other economic sectors, because it has been confined to foreign-owned manufacturing and assembling enterprises.
with its huge domestic economy, china would never have been able to accumulate such an enormous external surplus if its growth had not been confined to such enterprises.
pressure for revaluation stems, therefore, not from the real needs of china economy, but from large imbalances in the united states, particularly its long-standing trade deficit, which exceeds 5% of gdp.
however, dollar supremacy means that the us can sustain a much wider balance-of-payments deficit than other countries.
as long as asia holds its foreign reserves in dollars  china's desire to maintain a stable value for the reminbi will continue to offer tremendous advantages for trade and economic development.
the soft underbelly of china's growth
much of the concern over the past few years has centered on america's yawning current account and fiscal deficits, and its effort to get china to let the yuan float more freely against the dollar.
china, by contrast, sees its growth as tied to a stable currency, and may not want to introduce a more flexible exchange-rate regime, even after the 2.1% revaluation in july, pending alleviation of structural problems for which it is extremely difficult to set a timetable.
in fact, even as china's economy has boomed over the past decade, structural adjustment in its domestic sectors slowed, mainly owing to political constraints.
the banking system remains unhealthy and fragile; capital markets are dying.
the private sector's growth is hemmed in by its inability to invest in economic sectors that the government still monopolizes.
mounting regional disparities, as well as the widening urban-rural divide, impede household consumption growth, increasing the economy's dependence on exports and foreign investment.
for years, as optimists see it, china has been the world's cheap assembly shop for shoes, clothing, and microwave ovens.
now, it is laying the groundwork to become a global power in more sophisticated, technology-intensive industries.
billions of dollars are flowing into auto, steel, chemical, and high-tech electronics plants, setting the stage for china to be a major exporter of high-end products.
while this argument suggests that the global trading system must make more room for a rising china (and india), it overlooks the need to address the enormous structural problems in china's domestic sectors if export-led growth is to become sustainable.
for these sectors, rapid investment-driven growth in the past decade has produced a mountain of excess capacity, reflected in stagnant prices and the banking sector's soaring volume of bad loans, as price wars squeeze profitability and stimulate real-estate speculation.
postponing structural reforms eventually constrains any economy's performance, as we saw in japan in the 1980's and 1990's.
china has similar problems, with the investment-growth nexus threatening macroeconomic stability -- witness the overheating that occurred in 2003 and 2004.
indeed, china faces tremendous challenges in maintaining macroeconomic stability under conditions of export-led growth, with huge repercussions for the rest of the world.
given china's size and its rising share in the global market, macroeconomic instability there fuels volatility in global prices for basic commodities and raw materials.
but the political reality is that china's government favors rapid growth in the short run over the structural reforms needed to sustain long-term economic performance.
fiscal consolidation and the abrupt closure and restructuring of inefficient banks and state enterprises would, after all, constitute a powerful brake on short-term growth, threatening social peace and political stability.
this may explain the growing efforts of chinese businesses in recent years to go global themselves.
globalization is increasingly viewed as an alternative to domestic structural complexity.
this strategy will exact a heavy price, just as it did in japan twenty years ago.
the main lesson of japan's approach is that launching an aggressive buying spree overseas merely upsets established international balances of interests -- thus generating greater tensions with the rest of the world -- while hiding the seriousness of structural problems at home.
china has much to gain by avoiding such a strategy.
focusing squarely on structural reforms would allay some of the fears that china's rise has inspired in the rest of the world, while winning praise from the international business community.
rather than scaring global corporations and their home states, china would retain strong political support abroad -- and the financing that it needs for its continued development.
in economic terms, china has no choice: it must remove the structural obstacles that stand in the way of rapid growth over the next decade or two.
above all, truly secure and sustainable economic development requires that it build a large consumer base at home.
of course, the global imbalances associated with china's economic rise can take longer to adjust than they otherwise would, simply because the us welcomes it as being in america's own interest.
but china's long-term interest, and that of the world, requires that it get serious about domestic structural reform.
china's financial fetish
once upon a time, no one had any idea about how to create a "financial center."
a financial center was simply a great metropolis where enormous financial dealings took place.
cities such as london and new york became known as financial centers only after they had proved themselves in the role.
policymakers in china seem to be unaware that many major cities have not had the luck to become financial centers.
there is no economic or other theory that explains why a city called a "financial center" should be more valuable or lovely than others.
why, then, should china make developing global financial centers a vital national goal?
does china really need its own financial centers of world standing?
does the world need china to have them?
or is such a goal necessary because a financial center can determine the fate of a great metropolis?
nothing in the history of finance, the evolution of cities, or modern economics provides a clear answer.
it is the chinese who have endowed the term "financial center" with such weight and meaning by trying to dissect the functions of such cities and quantify every detail.
as a result, politicians are prepared to pick a city and order it to create the functions of a financial center, as if such a thing can be constructed like a building -- a concept that could not be more off the mark.
indeed, according to modern development models of finance, whether or not a physical center of finance exists is no longer a meaningful issue.
owing to historical factors and opportunities, financial transactions were concentrated in cities that were traditionally closely linked to the rise of european and american capitalism.
but what counts nowadays is not where financial transactions physically take place, but rather the growing importance and globalization of finance in the operation of the world economy.
cities do not become financial centers because they are more "excellent" than other cities, or because they have done something that other cities failed to do.
instead, once financial transactions begin to concentrate in a place, it becomes hard to move them to other places.
a free-market economy and its legal traditions &#45;&#45; both indispensable to the survival of financial centers -- certainly helps them to rise, but that initial rise has always been attributable to historical evolution, not government strategy.
in this sense, china's effort to deliberately create, through government fiat, global financial centers is both exacting and dogmatic.
there is no doubt that china needs its financial sector to develop soundly in order to ensure sustained economic growth.
and there is now a common understanding in china that meeting this objective requires that the government safeguard financial liberalization.
but progress has been slow, because china's politicians have put nurturing financial centers -- which should be the objective of local governments -- at the heart of the country's financial development.
indeed, equating financial liberalization with privileges for cities designated as "financial centers" undermines the very goals of liberalization -- namely, to reduce government control and to accelerate the development of financial markets.
china's financial system is failing in that respect, owing to frequent administrative and political intervention.
as a result, shanghai has been restricted from making the best of its financial functions, and hong kong, asia's acknowledged financial center, from assisting china's financial modernization.
what china needs most is a financial sector capable of harnessing the forces of liberalization and globalization to drive economic growth in the decades ahead.
the time has come to cast off the burden of building financial centers, and focus instead on advancing the modernization of chinese finance.
inflation comes to china
the "main stream" of china's economy is the vast flow of inward investment.
china's economy is prone to rapid growth, with buoyant investment demand sustaining powerful short-term inflationary pressures.
as a result, credit controls on investment projects and a close watch on the money supply have been used to promote macroeconomic stability since china began its market reforms.
but in 2003, following five years of deflation, china's economy entered a new phase.
overcapacity vanished, constraints on consumption were lifted, and a dramatic increase in household demand followed.
since then, heavy industries -- steel, automobiles, machinery, building materials, energy, and raw materials -- have experienced an unprecedented investment boom, reflecting demand for urban construction, housing, transport, infrastructure, and equipment renewal.
not surprisingly, the economy began to overheat.
productivity and profitability in manufacturing and heavy industries picked up, boosting china's national savings dramatically.
indeed, the huge increase in china's trade surplus in recent years is a consequence not of the renminbi's exchange rate, as many believe, but of the domestic savings' increase.
yet, from 2005 to early 2007, macroeconomic policy was focused on reining in the surplus.
most importantly, the renminbi was allowed to appreciate, and the export tax rebate was virtually eliminated.
in early 2007, because inflation was not really visible, the government did not regard it as a major problem.
but when price increases accelerated in the second half of the year, the authorities began to worry.
the central bank (pboc) initially attributed it to excess liquidity, and so began to use monetary policy tools, raising interest rates five times since late 2007.
as a result, the interest rate for 12-month fixed deposits has reached 3.9%.
moreover, the pboc has issued central bank notes six times, reinforcing its anti-inflationary effort.
nevertheless, by the end of october, m2 money supply had increased by 18.4% -- growing by 1.3% faster year on year, and exceeding the 16% target.
by the start of 2008, it was clear that controlling inflation and cooling an overheating economy had become the government's main economic target.
indeed, the government's key economic committee, the central work committee, has concluded that after years of "high growth and low inflation," china is on a route to "high growth with high inflation."
this invariably means that fiscal and monetary stability will become a priority while controlling the trade surplus has become a lower one.
the problem is that, until now, the major cause of inflation has been rapidly rising manufacturing costs, and there is no sign of a slowdown in energy and raw material prices.
moreover, a new labor law and income policies will further increase workforce costs.
and, due to rising consumer prices, the nominal interest rate will continue to rise.
as a result, with investment demand remaining robust, inflation could spread.
in the face of growing inflation, output is set to suffer.
in order to curb investment demand, tighter credit rationing and monetary policy are inevitable in 2008, while investment projects and land use will be subject to more rigorous control.
likewise, increasing pressure from growing labor costs will force enterprises to lower their profit expectations and cut costs, negatively affecting output growth and employment in the short run.
it will be difficult to ease these inflationary pressures this year. international commodity prices will continue to rise, increases in domestic labor costs and prices of non-tradable goods cannot easily be stemmed, the international economic situation will encourage further capital inflows, and asset inflation will persist.
all these factors will push inflation above the 2007 level.
with export performance also set to slow, owing to the economic downturn in the united states, employment and growth could be weakened further, which implies mounting pressure on china's government -- and thus on the fiscal deficit, creating another source of inflationary pressure.
and, once an inflationary trend emerges and economic growth slows, the steady- as-you go pattern to china's decade-long boom will be over.
why i published 'the tiananmen papers'
the chinese leadership's penchant for secretiveness is proverbial.
but the veil that exists over how that omnipotent party makes important decisions is being lifted somewhat because a volume of unique materials about the behind-the-scenes events surrounding the infamous tiananmen massacre of 1989 is being published this month.
the materials contained in that book, which i brought out of china and decided to make public, consist of hundreds of documents, including minutes and transcripts of meetings at which the most important leaders of the people's republic deliberated on how to handle the tienanmen demonstrations; key speeches; notes on crucial telephone conversations between leaders; classified reports from security agencies; and dispatches from the police and military.
taken as a whole, these documents provide a rare glimpse into the modus operandi of china's leaders.
as a witness and participant in the tiananmen events, and as someone with access to the historical archive, i felt it my duty to publish this record of the decisions that lay behind what happened.
the real truth of what happened in l989 was locked in secret party archives in beijing for over a decade.
i chose to involve myself in this personally risky project because i believe those who wish to serve china must reflect deeply on the lessons of the tiananmen events.
despite undergoing great changes in the years since 1989, china needs not only to reverse the verdict on the june 4th movement as "a counter-revolutionary rebellion," but also to restart its stalled process of political reform and democratization.
i believe that these documents will help serve those elusive ends.
although the massacre in tiananmen square of june 4, 1989 happened over ten years ago, it has not faded from people's memories.
chinese history seems frozen at that date.
far too many questions about those events remain unanswered.
the first step in achieving an accurate, complete, and objective re-evaluation of what happened must involve, as deng xiaoping famously said, a "search for truth in facts."
only then can the true face of history be restored.
i believe that the following four lessons should guide those who are working for change in china and have motivated my actions in this case.
first, even though the chinese communist regime has become thoroughly corrupt, it has strengthened itself through economic growth and improvement in people's lives.
these achievements have enabled it to intensify its organizational penetration into almost every corner of society.
no political force in china can stand up to it.
people who do not like what the party does must realize that they have nowhere else to turn; they can rely only on themselves.
even though the end of communism in china may seem a foregone conclusion, the fall of the chinese communist party will be accomplished not by an outside force but only by its own members.
second, given the lock that the communist party holds on all the levers of power, the building of democracy in china depends on forces rooted inside china.
those who have worked overseas for democracy, freedom, and the rule of law and who have sought the support of the international community have done necessary work.
but real solutions to china's problems must be sought at home.
third, change from inside is possible because the chinese communist party today resembles the communist party of the soviet union around 1989.
what looks on the outside like a solid structure can break into pieces overnight.
the chinese communist party has long since ceased to be a traditional communist party.
it is now a mélange of factions with diverse goals and differing ideologies.
the differences between radicals and conservatives in the party are now sharper than those between the party and its historic rival, the kuomintang.
the key force pushing for political change is the pro-democracy faction within the party.
so what will replace the chinese communist party will probably be a new force that emerges from inside the party; a group that regrets the errors of the communist system, a group committed to establishing a healthy democracy.
this group will unite with forces of democratization both at home and abroad to establish a truly democratic system.
fourth, reversal of the verdict on june 4th is an historical inevitability, as well as the wish of most of china's people.
june 4th weighs on the spirits of every chinese patriot; almost every chinese person knows that official reevaluation is just a matter of time.
indeed, the party's top leadership has been divided about the event ever since it occurred.
today, many of those responsible for the decision to crack down - notably deng xiaoping and others of the party elders -- have died.
so calls to reverse the verdict are growing, both inside and outside the party.
these calls will eventually form the mainstream, and the liberal forces within the party will undoubtedly respond by seizing a historic opportunity not only to reverse the verdict but to move toward discarding the communist system.
chinese democracy still has a long, hard road before it.
among other things, it needs a class of well-educated activists it lost when many young people left china to study and build a better life elsewhere.
even if risk and a large degree of self-sacrifice are required, these young people should return to join those in china, including those within the communist party, that are working for change.
as lu xun said, "a true warrior dares to stare the sadness of life in the face and to see the blood that drips there."
domestic spying and chinese politics
corruption charges are flying between prime minister zhu ronghi, china's number three leader, and li peng, the country's second leading politician.
those charges are, invariably, produced by china's domestic surveillance agencies.
but china's secret policemen are already working overtime nowadays, trying to keep up with china's millions of internet users.
none of this zeal is new in china.
paranoia, informers, and domestic spying are so essential to communist rule that few people are ever surprised at the extent of secret police operations here.
still, domestic spying did not arrive in china either with the computer revolution or mao's communist one.
indeed, the darkest moments in china's long history often coincide with massive domestic spying systems; usually these herald not only renewed tyranny but instability as well.
china's secret policemen, indeed, have deep roots.
the ming emperor cheng zu's internal espionage agency (1403-1424) was known as the dong chang or "eastern workshop."
staffed by eunuchs, it reported to the emperor directly.
cheng zu used the dong chang to bypass other state organs and persecute countless innocent people who had offended him.
cheng zu's regime marked one of the darkest times in china's long history.
the nationalist government of chiang kai-shek believed in domestic spying as well, and practiced it both before and after the communist takeover of 1949, with chiang's spies harshly suppressing any and all signs of domestic dissent.
nationalist "white terror" continued even after chiang kai-shek and his armies escaped to taiwan.
only the flowering of taiwan's democracy in recent years saw a decrease in domestic spying.
after being victimized by chiang kai-shek's spies, china's communist rulers created a vast spying apparatus of their own.
mao, indeed, called domestic spying "an invisible magic weapon."
today, although mao's socialist economy is shrinking, his spy networks remain as potent as ever.
indeed, jiang zemin, china's president and paramount leader, relies on spies from the public security bureau and the bureau of national security to maintain his rule.
as well as suppressing political dissent, these operatives play vital roles in the party's internal power struggles.
such spying is necessary, says jiang, in order to uphold the "stability" of communist rule in the face of vast and unsettling economic reforms.
like saturn devouring his children, however, chinese spying devours central committee members and dissidents alike.
cheng kejie, a high party official executed for corruption last year, was long under special surveillance by the public security bureau.
the purge of a former mayor of beijing, chen xitong, and his cronies, also on charges of corruption, could not have happened without evidence gathered by official spies.
indeed, it is widely believed that president jiang and his confidante zeng qinghong obsessively gather politically embarrassing evidence against corrupt officials in order to blackmail these officials into subservience.
a telling case here surrounds bao tong, a former politburo member who ran afoul of the president's inner circle.
bao is now under around-the-clock surveillance by eighteen state agents who have even set up a guard post in front of his house.
this is all happening despite party claims that bao retains all his citizenship rights.
lately, ms. he qinglian, a well-known author, journalist, and critic of china's reforms has been watched daily by as many as twelve agents.
government spies have hacked into her personal computer to download her files and documents and have forced their way onto her server to censor her emails and monitor and control her internet access.
"internet spies" of this type now flock to the many internet cafes found in china's major cities.
since the era of emperor cheng zu's dong chang domestic spying has been a sign of insecurity, not self-confidence.
domestic spying is growing and taking new forms nowadays because china's leaders, unsettled by the changes their own economic reforms have unleashed, bluntly refuse to consider democratic reforms.
this failure is progressively undermining the regime's legitimacy and the central committee knows it.
making matters worse are the repeated demonstrations of president jiang's profound lack of personal self-confidence.
china's president achieved and consolidated his power by relying on a small coterie drawn from his shanghai political base. the narrow circle of jiang's supporters reminds many people of unpopular emperors like cheng zu.
jiang's increasing dependence on internal spying and the "security apparatus" may also be due to jiang's close relations with his confidante zeng qinghong, the son of zeng shan, who was minister of the interior in charge of domestic espionage in the earliest days of communist rule.
under his father's tutelage, zeng qinghong learned to use spy networks to entrench communist and personal power.
given what happened in the former soviet union and its east european satellites, the paranoid fears about losing power are unlikely to vanish among chinese leaders soon.
jiang and his colleagues understand that governance-by-spying, through eviscerating personal responsibility and civil society, left behind moribund economies and discredited governments across the former soviet world.
instead of slackening domestic spying in order to prepare the chinese people for the ever increasing personal responsibility that a modern economy demands, however, jiang remains obsessed only with maintaining communist and personal power.
that failure may one day make china's inevitable postcommunist transition as corrupt and chaotic as that seen in the most violent and backwards of former soviet states.
tempting science
scientists everywhere are increasingly uneasy at the rising influence of business upon university research.
they realize that direct financial connections with the private sector can damage their reputation for independence and integrity.
nevertheless, the traditional doors separating academia from industry are being quietly dismantled - sometimes even smashed down.
specious free-market doctrines are devaluing the public services that those doors protected, not least the free flow of well-informed, critical speech that is vital to open inquiry.
of course every scientist wants more money to do research; and every nation needs as much good science as it can get.
but good science is expensive: so if some perfectly reputable company is prepared to pay for it, why be choosy?
industrial research is an immense asset to society, not least in advancing scientific knowledge.
but commercial firms are not philanthropies.
they are under constant competitive pressures; shareholders expect a return on their investment.
even when not trying to buy exclusive access to profitable new discoveries, they are always in the market for preferential consideration.
valuable gifts may appear to purchase intangible favours.
cash for scientific answers is not as obviously corrupt as cash for parliamentary questions, but smells as nasty.
so far, there have been few open scandals.
scientists in both academia and industry can still be trusted to do their work with honesty.
in most fields of university research, direct external influences - military and political as well as commercial - are trivial.
but a number of worrying cases of falsification or fabrication can be traced back to direct pressures from funding sources.
in some disciplines it is becoming difficult to find academic scientists who are not in some way dependent on corporate support.
the bodies that fund and publish research are now asking specialist referees and authors to declare all such connections, in case these might seem to affect their scientific judgement.
disclosure of `conflict of interest' is becoming as mandatory in the world of science as in politics and law.
most academic scientists doubtless hope that formal countermeasures like these will hold back the forces of mammon.
but increased transparency also reveals the blatant instrumentalism that now pervades university research.
demonstrable utility is the over-riding priority.
even governments now fund science primarily for its promise of public or private gain.
it enriches us spiritually with trustworthy knowledge about humanity and the world.
it warns us of hidden environmental dangers and opens up unexpected paths of technical progress.
it brings an element of hard-nosed critical rationality into all societal debate, and fosters awareness of uncertainty and change in the professional education of skilled practitioners.
above all, academic scientists are in continual demand as independent experts in public arenas of controversy and decision.
in short, university research is the principal intelligence agency of civil society.
it is often supposed that science is able to perform these functions because it is so completely rational and objective.
unfortunately, this supposition is not supported by serious philosophical analysis or sociological observation.
people seldom appreciate how deeply these characteristics are woven into the university tradition.
for example, lecturers and professors are not tested for their expertise, nor employed to carry out specific research projects.
nevertheless, customary practices such as `publish or perish,' peer review and academic tenure ensure that they are indeed good scientists.
they retain their intellectual autonomy, but could only have won their university posts - and thereby access to research facilities - on the basis of competitive assessments of the originality and promise of their published research.
the lucifer effect
such forces exist in many common behavioral contexts, distorting our usual good nature by pushing us to engage in deviant, destructive, or evil behavior.
when embedded in new and unfamiliar settings, our habitual ways of thinking, feeling, and acting no longer function to sustain the moral compass that has guided us reliably in the past.
over the past three decades, my research and that of my colleagues has demonstrated the relative ease with which ordinary people can be led to behave in ways that qualify as evil.
we have put research participants in experiments where powerful situational forces -- anonymity, group pressures, or diffusion of personal responsibility -- led them blindly to obey authority and to aggress against innocent others after dehumanizing them.
my recent book the lucifer effect: understanding how good people turn evil describes the radical transformations that took place among college students playing randomly assigned roles of prisoners and guards in a mock prison created at stanford university.
it goes on to establish direct parallels with the abuses committed by american soldiers at iraq's abu ghraib prison, presenting much of the social science research illustrating the power of social situations to dominate individual dispositions.
this body of work challenges the traditional focus on the individual's inner nature, dispositions, and personality traits as the primary -- and often the sole -- factors in understanding human failings.
instead, i argue that while most people are good most of the time, they can readily be led to act anti-socially, because most people are rarely solitary figures improvising soliloquies on the empty stage of life.
on the contrary, people are often in an ensemble of different players, on a stage with various props, costumes, scripts, and stage directions from producers and directors.
together, they comprise situational features that can dramatically influence behavior.
what individuals bring into any setting is important, but so are the situational forces that act on them, as well as the systemic forces that create and maintain situations.
most institutions that are invested in an individualistic orientation hold up the person as sinner, culpable, afflicted, insane, or irrational.
programs of change follow either a medical model of rehabilitation, therapy, reeducation, and treatment, or a punitive model of incarceration and execution.
but all such programs are doomed to fail if the main causal agent is the situation or system, not the person.
as a result, two kinds of paradigm shift are required.
first, we need to adopt a public health model for prevention of violence, spouse abuse, bullying, prejudice, and more that identifies vectors of social disease to be inoculated against.
second, legal theory must reconsider the extent to which powerful situational and systemic factors should be taken into account in punishing individuals.
although much of the lucifer effect examines how easy it is for ordinary people to be seduced into engaging in evil deeds, or to be passively indifferent to the suffering of others, the deeper message is a positive one.
it is by understanding the how and why of such deeds that we are in a better position to uncover, oppose, defy, and triumph over them.
by becoming more "evil smart," we build up resistance to having our moral compass reset negatively.
in this sense, the lucifer effect is a celebration of the human capacity to choose kindness over cruelty, caring over indifference, creativity over destructiveness, and heroism over villainy.
at the end of my narrative, i invite readers to consider fundamental strategies of resisting and challenging unwanted social influences, and i introduce the notion of "the banality of heroism."
after all, most heroes are ordinary people who engage in extra-ordinary moral actions.
with this in mind, i propose a situational perspective for heroism, just as i do for evil: the same situation that can inflame the hostile imagination and evil in some of us can inspire the heroic imagination in others.
we must teach people, especially our children, to think of themselves as "heroes-in-waiting," ready to take heroic action in a particular situation that may occur only once in their lifetime.
in praise of parasites
in 1933 primatologists discovered a red-and-black colored monkey living in the canopy of west africa's forests, which they named miss waldron's red colobus.
recently it was pronounced extinct - the first documented extinction of a primate since the 1700s.
after searching for six years, a team of scientists have not been able to find any sign of the monkey, leading them to conclude that heavy logging in the region killed off the last member of the species.
but when miss waldron's red colobus vanished, it did not go alone.
it also took with it into oblivion an unknown number of parasite species that made the monkey their home - parasites that might have included viruses, bacteria, protozoans, fungi, tapeworms, and other gruesome creatures.
we may be in the process of causing mass extinctions the likes of which the planet has not seen since an asteroid crashed into earth 65 million years ago.
surprisingly, it is parasites that will disappear in the greatest numbers, because parasites represent the vast majority of earth's biodiversity.
although researchers are divided over how many species exist - estimates vary from 5 to 30 million - it appears that four out of every five species is a parasite of some sort.
it can be difficult to grasp the fact that we live in an overwhelmingly parasitic world.
after all, we typically think of parasites with fear and loathing.
they are things to be eradicated or at the very least not discussed in polite company.
but parasites are nature's great success story.
they have been around for billions of years, and have evolved into a bizarre panoply of forms - nematodes that can curl up in a single muscle cell, crustaceans that clamp onto the eyes of greenland sharks, flatworms that live in the bladders of desert toads buried in the sand for 11 months out of every year.
parasites have evolved into remarkably sophisticated creatures along the way.
they can biochemically castrate their hosts, so that they don't waste energy making eggs or finding mates when they could be feeding the parasites.
parasites can even control the behavior of their hosts to ensure their own reproductive success.
many species of parasites, for example, need to live inside two or more species to complete their life cycle.
often the first host is prey for the second, and so the parasites helps the predators catch their prey.
toxoplasma, a protozoan that starts out in rats and other mammals, makes cats its final host.
a rat infected with toxoplasma is perfectly healthy, but it loses its instinctive fear when it smells a cat.
by altering the rat's neurochemistry, toxoplasma may make its hosts easier targets.
parasites may not win anyone's love, but they should win our respect.
so when we take strides to preserve biodiversity, we should not forget the parasites that live inside endangered hosts, like the ones that lived in miss waldron's red colobus.
for there are practical reasons to preserve biodiversity, and they apply to parasites just as much as to their hosts.
many of the most effective drugs, for example, were originally discovered in plants or animals.
parasites are masters of biotechnology.
consider hookworms.
these nasty creatures dig their fangs into the linings of the intestines in order to drink blood and lacerated flesh.
normally, clots would form in the wound, making it impossible for the hookworm to feed.
but the hookworm has evolved the ability to produce a molecule that elegantly jams up the cascade of chemical reactions that create clots.
biotech researchers are so impressed by the hookworm that they've synthesized the molecule and are testing it as a blood-thinning medicine that can be used during surgery.
the hookworm is but one species out of millions of parasites; other parasites may produce chemicals that can be used to stop organ rejection or to alter the brain.
if they disappear into extinction, they will take their secrets with them.
the contempt that many people have for parasites hides a profound uneasiness about our own role in nature.
we pride ourselves as the masters of nature, with the beasts of land and sea at our disposal.
yet parasites can sneak past our defenses and turn our bodies into their own playgrounds.
the fact that we will always be part of the natural world is, in some ways horrifying.
that horror is what makes parasites such a great device for science fiction movies such as alien.
but parasites make us uneasy in another way.
when you look at an aerial photograph of housing developments spreading into prairies or logging operations obliterating rain forests, it's hard to avoid entertaining a frightening possibility: we are parasites.
our host is the biosphere, which we exploit and consume for our own advantage, and to our host's detriment.
there may be something to this metaphor, but the lesson i take from it is not what others might.
to be called a parasite is not necessarily a bad thing.
parasites have been incredibly successful over the past four billion years of life's history.
if we are in fact parasites, we are not very good ones.
parasites make very careful use of their hosts, because killing them off too quickly will leave them without a home.
unlike other parasites, we have only one host, which means that we must be especially careful.
judging from the state of the world's rain forests, wetlands, and coral reefs, we're not.
we should learn from the masters.
henry paulson is wrong
under chapter 11, companies with a solid underlying business generally swap debt for equity.  old equity holders are wiped out and old debt claims are transformed into equity claims in the new entity which continues operating with a new capital structure.
alternatively, the debt-holders can agree to reduce the face value of debt, in exchange for some warrants.
so why not use this well-established approach to solve the financial sector's current problems?
the obvious answer is that we do not have time; chapter 11 procedures are generally long and complex, and the current crisis has reached a point where time is of the essence.
but we are in extraordinary times, and the government has taken and is prepared to take unprecedented measures.
as if rescuing the big insurer aig and prohibiting all short selling of financial stocks was not enough, now us treasury secretary henry paulson proposes buying up (with taxpayers' money) the distressed assets of the financial sector.
but at what price?
if banks and financial institutions find it difficult to recapitalize (i.e., issue new equity), it is because investors are uncertain about the value of the assets in their portfolios and do not want to overpay.
will government do better at valuing those assets?
in a negotiation between government officials and a banker with a bonus at risk, who will have more clout in determining the price?
paulson's plan would create a charitable institution that provides welfare to the rich -- at taxpayers' expense.
if the government subsidy is large enough, it will succeed in stopping the crisis.
but, again, at what price?
aside from costing billions of taxpayer dollars, paulson's plan violates the fundamental capitalist principle that whoever reaps the gains also bears the losses.
remember that in america's savings and loan crisis of the late 1980's, the government had to bail out those institutions, because their deposits were federally insured.
but in this case, the government does not have to bail out the debt-holders of bear sterns, aig, or any of the other financial institutions that will benefit from paulson's plan.
since we do not have time for chapter 11 proceedings and we do not want to bail out all the creditors, the lesser evil is to do what judges do in contentious and overextended bankruptcy processes: impose a restructuring plan on creditors, with part of the debt forgiven in exchange for equity or warrants.
there is precedent for such a bold move.
during the great depression, many debt contracts were indexed to gold.
so when the dollar's convertibility into gold was suspended, the value of that debt soared, threatening many institutions' survival.
president roosevelt's administration declared the clause invalid, forcing debt forgiveness.
my colleague and current fed governor randall koszner studied this episode and showed that not only stock prices, but also bond prices, soared after the supreme court upheld the decision.
how is that possible?
as corporate finance experts have been saying for 30 years, having too much debt and too little equity is costly, so reducing the face value of debt can sometimes benefit not only equity-holders, but also debt-holders.
but, while debt forgiveness benefits holders of both equity and debt, debt-holders don't voluntarily agree to it for two reasons.
first, even if each individual debt-holder benefits, he or she will benefit even more if everybody else cuts the face value of their debt and he or she does not.
hence, everybody waits for others to move first, creating obvious delay.
second, from a debt-holder's point of view, a government bailout is better.
even talk of a government bailout reduces the debt-holders' incentive to act, making the bailout more necessary.
as during the great depression and in many debt restructurings, it makes sense in the current contingency to mandate partial debt forgiveness or a debt-for-equity swap in the financial sector.
it is a well-tested strategy, and it leaves taxpayers out of the picture.
forcing a debt-for-equity swap or debt forgiveness would be no greater a violation of private property rights than a massive bailout.
but, for the major players in the financial sector, it is much more appealing to be bailed out by the taxpayers.
indeed, for the financial industry, the appeal of paulson's proposal is precisely that it taxes the many and benefits the few.
since the many (taxpayers) are dispersed, we cannot put up a good fight in the us congress, whereas the financial industry is well represented politically.
for six of the last 13 years, the treasury secretary was a goldman sachs alumnus.
the decisions that congress must make now will affect not only the us economy's short-term prospects, but will shape the type of capitalism that we will have for the next 50 years.
do we want to live in a system where profits are private, but losses are socialized, where taxpayer money is used to prop up failed firms?
or do we want to live in a system where people are held accountable for their decisions, where imprudent behavior is penalized and prudent behavior rewarded?
for anyone who believes in free markets, the most serious risk of the current situation is that the interest of a few financiers will undermine the capitalist system's fundamental workings.
the time has come to save capitalism from the capitalists.
censor and sensibility
acquiescing to such censorship might have been necessary when printing presses, delivery trucks, news kiosks, or transmission towers were the only way to get printed publications or broadcast programs to news consumers.
but internet publishing offers a new -- and potentially lucrative -- opportunity for the distribution of uncensored information.
such freedom is not automatic, because even the internet's inherent openness can be largely defeated by assiduous government filtering and surveillance.
however, in recent years, sustained research into countermeasures against such third-party interference in internet communications has begun to add a new factor.
the bulk of this research has not been conducted in university labs or corporate r&amp;d facilities, but spontaneously by teenagers, who use it to share copyrighted music with one another without paying for it.
western media outlets have covered this story with great interest, yet apparently without realizing that these peer-to-peer technologies have the potential to de-censor the news for more people in countries like china, where any online content that runs counter to the chinese communist party's current line risks falling victim to the "great firewall" of censorship.
peer-to-peer technologies make filtering more difficult, because they put nearly any consumer of information into the process of transmitting it.
for example, without endangering those in china, news organizations could conclude deals with other companies to ensure that uncensored reports are echoed from one free server to the next, thereby defying china to filter the entire internet if it wishes to eliminate content.
of course, news organizations operate as businesses, and defying powerful governments can be a bad business strategy.
that is why there has been so little rebellion, or even remonstration, among media companies when authoritarian governments threaten journalists, editors, and publishers.
it also explains why journalists in those countries have so often bent over backwards to apologize for individual transgressions, rather than stand in defiance.
but news organizations could reach many more people if they worked to circumvent internet filtering instead of passively relying on those inside the firewall to figure out how to reach beyond blocked sites on their own.
doing so might even make good business sense.
building a creative digital distribution system that eludes government censors would help news organizations establish and enlarge their markets.
indeed, it is not implausible that when a government's repressive policies diminish, or end through regime change, media outlets that were present and government-approved will fare poorly vis-à-vis offshore counterparts that stayed away and conveyed the truth.
if news outlets in physically remote open societies meet consumers in countries like china halfway, the benefits for both the chinese and the bottom line could be enormous.
along with the enterprising teenagers who built napster, academics like lorrie faith cranor at carnegie mellon mapped out the shape of potential new networks with lofty names like "publius," through which unpopular views could be circulated outside of easy governmental control.
a team of computer scientists at stanford and elsewhere created a project called "lockss," which retains decentralized mirrored copies of documents, and detects corruption or forgery among them, to preserve the integrity of our written histories forever.
those who consider themselves members of the global free press should collectively strive to construct similar networks over which news and reporting can run free and be available to anyone with an internet connection.
building such a network would be far cheaper than constructing even a single new printing plant -- and it would be far more effective.
we should consider the front pages of every free nation's newspapers as a precious set of documents, to be replicated and shared openly throughout the world, especially in countries where heavy state censorship exists.
thanks to the internet, the risks in realizing these new distribution networks are really only business risks -- and thus are quantifiable and manageable.
they pale in comparison to the risks taken by dissidents in closed societies.
putting those front pages on a filtered web site should be only a beginning.
it's time find a way to circulate those front pages everywhere.
it makes good political sense; it could make good business sense as well.
modernizing multilateralism
as always, the poor are the most defenseless.
for developing countries, tighter credit conditions and much weaker growth mean that governments are less able to meet education and health goals, and to invest in the infrastructure needed to sustain growth.
remittances are drying up.
already 100 million people have been driven into poverty as a result of high food and fuel prices, and current estimates suggest that every 1% decline in developing-country growth rates pushes an additional 20 million people into poverty.
countries are trying to break the credit freeze, bolster financial institutions, ease interest rates, strengthen safety nets, and revive consumption and investment in order to boost business, enable people to work, and lay the foundation for future growth.
these steps will be most effective if countries act in concert, in a mutually supportive way.
economic nationalism that seeks gains from the disadvantage of others will trigger ever more dangers.
global challenges require global solutions.
in october, i called for modernizing multilateralism and markets to better reflect the changing world economy and to enable countries to act in concert to address interconnected problems.
looking beyond the old g-7 system, we need a twenty-first-century approach to multilateralism through the dynamism of a flexible network, not new hierarchies of a fixed or static system.  
the new multilateralism must maximize the strengths of interdependent and overlapping actors and institutions, public and private.
it should reach beyond the traditional focus on finance and trade, to include other pressing economic and political issues: development, energy, climate change, and stabilizing fragile and post-conflict states. it needs to draw together existing international institutions, with their expertise and resources, to reform them when necessary, and encourage effective cooperation and common action.
multilateralism, at its best, is a means for solving problems among countries, with the group at the table willing and able to take constructive action together. it needs to draw its strength -- and legitimacy -- from both broader participation and by achieving results.
november's g-20 summit brought to the table for the first time the rising powers as active stakeholders to address the global financial crisis.
they agreed to a good agenda, but the true test will be the follow-up.
it is a positive step that leaders of major developed economies are now meeting with leaders from the rising economic powers.
but the poorest developing countries must not be left out in the cold.
we will not solve this crisis, or put in place sustainable long-term solutions, by accepting a two-tier world.
the goal must be to build an inclusive and sustainable globalization.
trillions of dollars are now being spent on a financial rescue in the developed world.
by comparison, about $100 billion a year is currently being spent on overseas aid.
we need a "human" rescue as well as a financial rescue.
in this environment, the global commitment to provide development assistance to the poorest countries must be paramount. 
at the world bank group, we are scaling up our financial support for those in need.
we are speeding up grants and long-term, interest-free loans to the world's 78 poorest countries, half of them in africa.
donors last year pledged $42 billion over three years for the world bank's fund for these countries, the international development association (ida).  this money is vital if we are to meet the millennium development goals.
in addition, the bank's lending arm to developing countries, the international bank for reconstruction and development (ibrd), could make new commitments of more than $35 billion this fiscal year -- almost triple last year's -- and up to $100 billion over the next three years.
this increase is aimed at protecting the poorest and most vulnerable from harm, supporting countries that face borrowing problems because of broken credit markets, and helping to sustain investments upon which recovery and long-term development will depend.
our private sector arm, the international finance corporation (ifc), is launching or expanding three facilities to help the private sector, expected to total around $30 billion over the next three years.
they will address high-priority problems that have emerged in recent months: expanding trade finance, recapitalizing banks in poorer countries, and sustaining infrastructure investment by helping viable projects facing a liquidity crisis. 
at the same time, we will continue special efforts to counter malnutrition and hunger, and provide energy to the poor.  our newly launched $6 billion climate investment funds will build practical experience with technology, forestation, and adaptation to support the united nations negotiations on climate change and assist developing countries.
as the world digs out of the current financial and economic hole, we need to look further ahead.
today's crises reflect the lightning speed of an interconnected world.  the factors that produced this globalization offer great opportunities to overcome poverty, increase opportunity, and open societies.  but we will need a new multilateralism to expand the availability of these benefits to all.
